    <h1>Orges</h1>

    <h2>Introduction to Orges</h2>
    <div class="section">

      <p>Ogres are legendary creatures known across many cultures, most commonly featured in folklore, fairy tales, and fantasy fiction. These beings are usually portrayed as gigantic, strong, and fearsome, often with grotesque features and violent habits. The image of the ogre has evolved over time—from terrifying monsters to more complex or even comedic characters.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Appearance and Characteristics</h2>
    <div class="section">

      <p>Traditionally, ogres are described as massive humanoids with thick, tough skin, wild hair, large tusks or teeth, and a generally ugly appearance. They often have broad shoulders, large hands, and a menacing expression. Some stories describe them with warts, hunched backs, or even animal-like traits. Their strength is one of their most defining features—an ogre can crush bones, tear down trees, and overpower almost any human.</p>
      <p>Despite their physical power, ogres are usually considered unintelligent or slow-witted. They act on instinct or emotion rather than logic, and this is often their downfall in stories where clever humans outsmart them.</p>

    <h2>Folklore and Traditional Roles</h2>
    <div class="section">

      <p>In European folklore, ogres often play the role of the villain. They kidnap, eat, or enslave people—especially children. Famous tales like <strong>"Jack and the Beanstalk"</strong> and <strong>"Hop-o’-My-Thumb"</strong> feature ogre-like giants who live in isolated places, hoard treasure, and enjoy hunting humans. These stories use ogres to symbolize danger and fear, often warning children to stay away from the unknown or to use their wits when facing a stronger foe.</p>
      <p>In French folklore, the word “ogre” first appeared in the 17th century, notably in Charles Perrault’s fairy tales. These early literary ogres were savage and cannibalistic, serving as cautionary figures.</p>

    <h2>Ogres Around the World</h2>

        <strong>Japan –</strong> <em>Oni</em> are large, horned demons often compared to ogres. They carry iron clubs, wear tiger skins, and appear in myths as both evil spirits and punishers of wrongdoers.

        <strong>India –</strong> Creatures like <em>Rakshasas</em> can be ogre-like, with shape-shifting powers, magical abilities, and a hunger for human flesh.

        <strong>Native American –</strong> Some legends describe giant beings or forest spirits that resemble ogres, lurking in the wilderness and threatening humans who stray too far from their villages.
      </p>

      <p>These variations show that ogre-like figures are universal, representing primal fears and the struggle between humans and the powerful forces of nature or darkness.</p>

    <h2>Modern Depictions</h2>
    <div class="section">
      <img src="https://cdn-flnkc.nitrocdn.com/KFlCDdxHmXxwfeAbWXbVTSQOtYohfXjT/assets/images/optimized/rev-fb4b5b1/static.voices.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/shrek-2048x1152.jpg" alt="Shrek" class="inline-img" />
      <p>Modern fantasy and media have transformed ogres into more varied characters. The most famous example is <strong>Shrek</strong>, a kind-hearted but misunderstood ogre who challenges the stereotypes of his kind. In fantasy role-playing games like <strong>Dungeons & Dragons</strong>, ogres are usually still brutish enemies, but they can also be part of a fantasy world’s ecology or even play unusual roles, like bodyguards or misunderstood warriors.</p>
      <p>In video games, films, and books, ogres may still be monsters—but they might also be comic relief, allies, or even heroes. This shift reflects changing views about “monsters” and what they represent: fear of the unknown, fear of being judged, or the need to look beyond appearances.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Symbolism and Meaning</h2>
    <div class="section">
      <p>Ogres often symbolize raw, <strong>untamed power, the fear of the wild, or the threat of the unknown.</strong> They can also reflect the darker side of humanity—violence, greed, and cruelty. On the other hand, modern stories show that ogres can symbolize outsiders, those who don’t fit in but still have value, depth, and goodness within them.</p>
      <p>Because of their flexibility and deep roots in myth, ogres continue to be powerful figures in storytelling across genres.</p>
